# Over the Mystic

A project by Anna Kasagawa, Monsurat Olaosebikan, and Rebecca Alpert

## Work completed as of October 1, 2017:  
* Added home screen view with buttons (still need to add some sort of welcome graphic)
* Added function in MainActivity that recognizes which button has been clicked so we can run bike tour functionality vs. walking tour functionality
* Added intents for bike tour vs. walking tour to get to the respective next activities 
* Added new placeholder activities and views for bike tour and walking tour (including back buttons to main screen)

## Work completed as of October 5, 2017:
* Simplified down to two activities: MainActivity and StartTourActivity
* MainActivity uses an intent to send a string to StartTourActivity based on your button press
* The message shown by StartTourActivity is based on that string

## Work completed as of October 19, 2017:
* Implemented basic location detail screen with streaming audio and image pulled in via Glide
* Location detail is currently static; need to start using real data
